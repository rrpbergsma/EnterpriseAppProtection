# Enterprise App Protection

## What This Extension Does

Protect yourself and your organization from phishing attacks that impersonate common enterprise applications like DocuSign, Salesforce, Microsoft 365, and hundreds more. This extension:

- ✓ Automatically scans links in your browser and emails
- ✓ Alerts you when a link claims to be from a trusted enterprise app but leads to an unofficial domain
- ✓ Maintains an up-to-date database of legitimate enterprise application domains
- ✓ Works with 150+ popular enterprise applications
- ✓ Functions completely offline after initial setup

## How It Works

When you visit a webpage or open an email, the extension:

1. Checks if any enterprise applications (like "DocuSign" or "Salesforce") are mentioned
2. Verifies if the associated links actually go to official domains
3. Shows a clear warning if it detects a potential impersonation attempt
